calculator bugs:

1. when the top number has a  number and operator selected.. you can not switch the operator without restarting basically.

if (top Num != '' && bottomNum == '' && operatorLoaded == true && another operator clicked) {
	operator is changed to new operator
}

2. equals button not working
